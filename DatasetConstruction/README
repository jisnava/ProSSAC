PISCES_1.txt - Extracted ids from PISCES server

PISCES_11_40ID_A_CHAIN_ID_only.txt - extracted only A chain ids from 1_Pisces_40ID.txt using the program 1_PISCES_modified.py
 
Then download the files of those proteins using the program 2_parallel_downloader.py. And the results are stored in 18_PDB folder.

Extract only CA ATOM record from protein files using the program 3_CA_extraction.py. Result in 18_PDB_CA folder.

Extract only first chain details from 18_PDB_CA using the program 4_CA_chainwise.py and the results in 18_PDb_CA_A(But this has not only A chain but other chain details also).

Extract AA name and coordinates only using the program 5_AA_coord_extraction.py and the results in 18_PDB_CA_COORD(9299 protein files). Here users can extract other chain details also, by a small modification to the given code.

ss.txt - has secondary structure(DSSp) as well as primary sequence details, and is downloaded from RCSB-PDB.

Extract only A chain details from ss.txt using the program 6_1_secstr_A_chain_only.py and the result in 6_A_CHAIN_SECSTR.txt.

Extract those(1_Pisces_40ID_A_CHAIN_ID_only.txt) protein details from 6_A_CHAIN_SECSTR.txt and put the result in 7_a_secondary_extraction.txt.

Remove line splits from 7_a_secondary_extraction.txt. using 8_remove_line_splits.py and results are saved in 8_line_splits_removed_from_7.txt.

Remove new lines from 8_line_splits_removed_from_7.txt using 8_remove_new_line.py and results in 9_new_line_removed_from_8.txt.

Replace spaces in secondary sequence using 11_secstr_replace_with_C.py and the results in 10_replace_gap_with_C.txt.

Again new line comes, remove it using any code and the results in 11_new_line_removed_from_10.txt.

Then one more time, copy the primary and secondary sequences from 11_new_line_removed_from_10.txt by comparing with ids in 1_Pisces_40ID_A_CHAIN_ID_only.txt and the result is stored in 12_Our_and_their_A_chain_only_new_line_removed.txt

Secondary structure of some of the proteins in 1_Pisces_40ID_A_CHAIN_ID_only.txt may be missing from ss.txt.

To find and remove it from folder 18_PDB_CA_COORD, extract the protein ids in 12_Our_and_their_A_chain_only_new_line_removed.txt using 7_extract_protein_ids_from_secondary_structure_file.py 
and the results in 13_extracted_ID_check_list, and the difference between 13_extracted_ID_check_list and 1_Pisces_40ID_A_CHAIN_ID_only.txt is calculated using 9_difference_calculator.py with the result in 14_difference_A_chain_IDs.txt(Note that V is not a python code ).

Now this difference protein ids are deleted from the folder 18_PDB_CA_COORD using the program using 15_to_remove_difference_files_from_folder.py,(which now contain 9113 files).

One problem comes after alignment is that, still I found some protein files in 18_PDB_CA_COORD folder with chain extensions other than A chain. 
These creates problems while doing alignment. 
So I selected only those files having .pdb_A extensions and deleted others.

Now the folder has 9021 protein files.

__________________________________________________________________________

Now we have primary and tertiary of the protein files we have downloaded from RCSB-PDB and primary and secondary sequencences obtained from ss.txt. 
What we need is the secondary from ss.txt corresponding to tertiary from 18_PDB_CA_COORD. 
We can't copy this directly. There are mismatches and length variations.So we have to do the alignment of two primary sequences - one we have and the other from ss.txt.
This alignment is done using 13_aligning_two_primary.py and the result in 18_16_aligned_results.txt
Aligned results are arranged using 14_aligned_results.py

Next we compared the ids in the result and the previous file using 7_a_extract_protein_ids_from_17.py and both are same. Hence it's ok.

___________________________________________________________________________

While doing alignment one problem occur. In some protein files a single aminoacid has two CA atompositions(reason) in ATOM records. Hence if this is not eliminated, 
the name appears twice in our primary sequence and this creates problemsin alignment. 
We avoided it in chainwise extraction program( 4_CA_chainwise.py)

__________________________________________________________________________

Now arrange the aligned results, using so that our primary, aligned result and secondary sequence are kept in one file 18_17_aligned_with_three_sequence.txt. 
This is one input for final file along with the 18_PDB_CA_COORD folder. 

Now run the final program in server 15_final_dataset_file_to_server_new.py and results in three files  - 18_new_file.txt, 18_new_file_in.txt and 18_new_file_out.txt
