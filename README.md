 Assigning Secondary Structure Elements to Proteins using Deep Learning Techniques.

This project includes the following:

 1) Creation of datasets (PDB40SI and PDB50SI).
  The readme file in the 'DatasetConstruction' folder contains information about the dataset's construction.
 3) Deep Learning models- trained on the newly constructed dataset. The models experimented are available as a notebook file in the 'Models' folder.
 
Additionally, users can also generate outputs without training the model using the saved model and its weights (in the SavedModelsandWeights folder). The users must, however, generate the test set (Test set I) independently or by following the same procedure as described in dataset construction.

Test set II is selected randomly from the newly created dataset(available in Dataset9021 and Dataset22532PDB50SI folders)  without any other construction procedures. The text and NumPy(available upon request) formats are available.
