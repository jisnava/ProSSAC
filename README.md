Using Deep Learning to Assign Secondary Structure Elements to Proteins.

This endeavour entails the following:

Assignment on Secondary Structures Procedure for creating a data set and developing a model.

The readme file in the corresponding folder contains information about the dataset's construction.

Additionally, notebooks containing details about various deep learning models are included. Users can also generate outputs without training the model using the saved model and its weights. They must, however, generate the test set (Test set I) independently or following the same procedure as described in dataset construction.

Test set II can be generated at random from the provided dataset without any construction procedure. There are text and NumPy formats to choose from.
