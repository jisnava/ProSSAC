 Assign Secondary Structure Elements to Proteins using Deep Learning Techniques.

This project includes the following:

 1) Creation of a dataset.
  The readme file in the corresponding folder contains information about the dataset's construction.
 3) Deep Learning models- trained on the newly constructed dataset.
Additionally, notebooks containing various deep learning models are included. Users can also generate outputs without training the model using the saved model and its weights. They must, however, generate the test set (Test set I) independently or by following the same procedure as described in dataset construction.

Test set II is selected randomly from the newly created dataset without any other construction procedures. The text and NumPy formats are available.
