This is PDB50SI dataset:(22,532 structures and 5,102,185 residues)-refer ppaper for more details.
The labels are given in eight-class format, so that users can convert them to three-class when needed.

Includes the entire dataset information - the Inputs and outputs in separate files.
The entire dataset file is split into three parts- The users can merge those files to get the entire dataset file.

The input file is also split into two parts- The users can merge those files to get the entire input file.

One hot encoded output label is used in the output file. (Codes for one hot encoding(of labels and the dictionary used for inputs) may be found in the - toonehot.py folder)

The numpy files are not uploaded here because of their large size. 
However, it will be made accessible upon request to the corresponding author (jisna_p170107cs@nitc.ac.in) 
OR
Using a programming language, users can convert the input and output files to numpy format, suitable for training purposes. 

We use the following convention for converting to numpy format:

Input file has 23 dimensions, including 20 for one-hot amino acid encoding and 3 for 3D coordinates.
One hot encoding of three class secondary structure states is present in the output file.
