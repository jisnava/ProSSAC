This is PDB40SI dataset: (9021 structures and 1,965,868 residues)-refer ppaper for more details.

Includes the entire dataset information - the Inputs and outputs in separate files.

One hot encoded output label is used in the output file. (Codes for one hot encoding may be found in the - toonehot.py folder)

The numpy files are not uploaded here because of their large size. 
However, it will be made accessible upon request to the corresponding author (jisna_p170107cs@nitc.ac.in) 
OR
Using a programming language, users can convert the input and output files to numpy format, suitable for training purposes. 

We use the following convention for converting to numpy format:

Input file has 23 dimensions, including 20 for one-hot amino acid encoding and 3 for 3D coordinates.
One hot encoding of three class secondary structure states is present in the output file.
